# Rlox - rust implementation of Jlox
This is a Rust implementation of the first part of the Crafting Interpreters book, where I attempted to recreate the Java interpreter using Rust. I paused my progress after completing the functions chapter. My project has a bug in recurison that I might fix later, but probably I will rewrite the project later on. Seeing that this was mostly for learning rust and setting up a project that's larger than an Advent of Code challange.
